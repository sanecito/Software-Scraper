# Software Scraper
## What is Software Scraper?

Software Scraper is a program for Windows that scraps a list of all the installed software and related info on your computer and allows you to easily export it to a file.

## Why would I use Software Scraper?

There are cases where installing some piece of software or firmware causes loss of installed software such a driver update completely corrupting your PC. It can be frustrating having to remember all of the software you had installed. This takes out some of the frustration by providing an easy means to create a list of installed software before you do something that could cause loss of installed software info. You can then save that info either in a printed, cloud, or external hard drive storage solution.

## Any future major features planned?

Yes, it is planned that eventually this product will be able to scrape the serial numbers/product keys allowing for easy referral of serial numbers/product keys when reinstalling software.

## Why are you writing this?

Currently there is a powerful freeware tool out there called Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder (and it's non-freeware sibling, Recover Keys) that is the standard for getting software keys and has other related functionality. However, it is pretty limiting with respect to being able to export; Keyfinder can only export one piece of software at a time which can be frustrating when you have 60+ pieces of software and only want to have all your info in one file. Also, it comes bundled with bloat/spyware. Software Scraper aims to eventually develop feature parity with Keyfinder while providing more features with no spyware.
